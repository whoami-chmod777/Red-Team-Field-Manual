-- Windows Privilege Escalation Checklist --

·Enumerate all File Servers in a domain and net view to find open shares. Once all shares are located, enumerate all share files/folders for sensitive data such as: administrative info, credentials, user home directories, etc. Repeat against other systems in the domain (other server roles like database, web, etc.) which may have misconfigured network shares exposing sensitive data.
·Enumerate PATH and then .DLL hijack (wlbsctrl or scheduler) if applicable.
·Run open-source tool "SharpUp" to enumerate potential privilege escalation opportunities such as vulnerable paths, weak service information, and more.
·Enumerate startup folder, user scheduled tasks, etc. Attempt to poison global shared scripts set to run at login.
·Gain access to administrative shares and attempt to poison scripts run by administrators or macro enabled files.
